# artifical_life_simulation
This repository contains code example of Agent based modeling / Game theory.
This codes are written in Matlab R2017a. 
Game theoy - mathematical framework for strategic interactions of individuals.

Properties of Agent:
1. Agents are autonomous.
2. Agents are interdependent.
3. Agents follow simple rules.
4. Agents are adaptive and backward-looking.

Agent-based simulations:
1.   The models simulate the simultaneous operations of multiple agents, in an attempt to re-create and
predict the actions of complex phenomena.
2.   Agents can be pedestrians, animals, customers, internet users, etc...

Programming an agent-based simulator often goes in five steps:
1.   Initialization - initial state, parameters; environment.
2.   Time loop - processing each time steps.
3.   Agents loop - processing each agents.
4.   Update - Upadating agent i at time t.
5.   Save data - For further analysis.
